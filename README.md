**TASK 2**:
 FRAUD DETECTION IN FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS


**Description**:
Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions in a financial dataset.

Steps:

**Data Collection**:
Obtain historical transaction data, including features like transaction amount, timestamp, etc.

**Data Preprocessing**:
Clean the data, handle missing values, and balance the dataset if needed.

**Feature Engineering**:
Extract relevant features and engineer new ones that could aid in fraud detection.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
Visualize patterns and anomalies in the data using graphs and statistics.

**Model Selection**:
Choose classification algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, or Neural Networks.

**Model Training**:
Train the model on the preprocessed dataset.

**Model Evaluation**:
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Tech Stack**:

Python,

Data manipulation libraries,

Machine learning libraries,

Deep learning libraries.
